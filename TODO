  * set default feed refresh time to 10 minutes 
  * is feeds-db being populated as the browser naturally refreshes feeds? 
    * doesn't seem to be?
  * Get extension developer extension, js debugger, firebug
  * someone clears and a feed publishes a new unread item
    in the time interval between last fetch and clear?
      ---- ERRR--DO THIS:
        - sequence - each item in feed_items has an id, set according to when the feed was
                     grabbed, not when it was published or anything.
        - getFeeds - item_num > bookmark_num
        - delFeeds - item_num < bookmark_num and other logic
  * force livemark reload - 'refresh' link
    * refresh feeds button -- reloadLivemarkFolder()
    * allow people to set live bookmarks refresh time
    * always call them "live bookmarks" in the UI
  * delete livemarks (on hover)
  * 
  * Need to make sure that if the feed is broken we still load other feeds.
  * different rss date formats - dc:date, pubDate
  *   * pubDate is optional - go w/ grabbed date otherwise somehow
  * better error handling in general
  * Atom feeds
  * Add a 'read' toggle to entries?  Show only unread.  (leave the rest of the clearing / removal code the same)
  * Why PhilipRSS? I wanted something *insanely* simple.  A single page with my feeds.  FF does the rest.  Everything here, let's me clear it when I want.  I want the reader to not look like shit, too.  And that's it.

    I want to be looking at well layed-out print.
